### 💤 Free Tier Limitations

### ⚡ Keep Bot Active (Optional)
To prevent sleeping, you can:

1. **Ping Service:** Use a service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) to ping your URL every 14 minutes
2. **Cron Jobs:** Set up a cron job to visit your URL periodically
3. **Upgrade:** Consider Render's paid plan for always-on service

### 🔄 Auto-Deploy
- **Automatic updates:** Any push to your `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- **Zero downtime:** Render handles deployments seamlessly
- **Rollback:** Easy rollback to previous versions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🚫 Common Issues

1. **"Application failed to respond"**
   - Check build logs in Render dashboard
   - Ensure `npm start` works locally
   - Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

2. **"Build failed"**
   - Check if Node.js version is compatible
   - Ensure `package.json` has correct scripts
   - Review build logs for specific errors

3. **QR Code not showing**
   - Wait for full deployment completion
   - Check if web server is running on correct port
   - Refresh the page after 30 seconds
