# Keep-Alive Configuration
# Internal self-ping: Every 3 minutes (enhanced)
# Recommended: Add external monitoring (UptimeRobot) every 5 minutes
# This prevents Render free tier from spinning down (15-min timeout)

# Authentication Persistence
# The bot now automatically backs up authentication data to survive deployments
# Uses multiple backup locations:
# 1. ./auth-backup (Local directory - works on Render)
# 2. /tmp/auth-backup (Temporary storage)
# 3. Environment variables as fallback
# Auth backups expire after 7 days for security
# Backup frequency is throttled to prevent spam (30s cooldown)
# Use .backuptest command to verify backup system status
